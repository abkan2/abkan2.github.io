        <h1>Week 2</h1>

        <p>The second week here was also amazing after all the craziness from the first week I got to explore the city a little bit. The people here are nice. I tried some new food spots like In and Out, Jack in the Box, and Dave's Hot Chicken since these restaurants aren't available where I'm from. I also got to visit a couple of gyms and even got a gym membership for my stay here. Overall this week was great.</p>
