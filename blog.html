          My first week on campus went great. There was a little hiccup at the airport with the airline accidentally sending one of my pieces of luggage to California but that was taken care they were nice and even gave me a 100-dollar gift card. On my first day on campus, my lab mates for the summer showed me around the lab and where I'll be working. The campus is nice and since this is my first time this far west from home I was caught off guard by all the mountains and how much less humid it is out here compared to Maryland. I had my first team meeting with my mentor and the rest of the lab and we introduced each other. They seem nice.

           <p class = "posts"> The second week here was also amazing after all the craziness from the first week I got to explore the city a little bit. The people here are nice I tried some new food spots like In and Out, Jack in the Box, and Dave's Hot Chicken since these restaurants aren't available where I'm from. I also got to visit a couple of gyms and even got a gym membership for my stay here. Overall this week was great.
