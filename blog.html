        <h1>Week 2</h1>

        <p>The second week here was also amazing after all the craziness from the first week I got to explore the city a little bit. The people here are nice. I tried some new food spots like In and Out, Jack in the Box, and Dave's Hot Chicken since these restaurants aren't available where I'm from. I also got to visit a couple of gyms and even got a gym membership for my stay here. Overall this week was great.</p>

        <h1> Week 3</h1>

        <p> This week, I made more progress on my project. I’ve been refining the literature matrix with Dr. Patil's feedback and started drafting the SoK outline. It’s been interesting diving deeper into how games can teach security and privacy—it made me think a lot about what really grabs a player’s attention. Outside of the lab, I hung out with some of the other interns and explored more of the downtown area. We found a cool arcade, and I spent way too much time playing old-school games. I also got a chance to try out hiking, which is something totally new to me. The views were amazing, and it’s crazy how different the air feels compared to Maryland!</p>


        <h1> Week 4 </h1>
        <p> This week was all about tightening up my SoK outline. I had a lot of back-and-forth with my mentor about how to categorize certain games and what methodologies were the most effective. It’s exciting but challenging work. In my free time, I decided to check out the campus gym, and I’ve been hitting it regularly now. I’ve also been brushing up on my JavaScript skills since I’ve been thinking about building a personal project soon. One night, a group of us decided to binge-watch some movies, and it was nice to kick back after a hectic week.</p>
