My first week on campus went great. There was a little hiccup at the airport with the airline accidentally sending one of my pieces of luggage to California but that was taken care of; they were nice and even gave me a 100-dollar gift card. On my first day on campus, my lab mates for the summer showed me around the lab and where I'll be working. The campus is nice, and since this is my first time this far west from home, I was caught off guard by all the mountains and how much less humid it is out here compared to Maryland. I had my first team meeting with my mentor and the rest of the lab and we introduced each other. They seem nice
